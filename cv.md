### **About me**

My main goal is to get up-to-date knowledge in the field of front-end development. I consider independence, stress resistance, honesty as my strengths. Civil engineer by education, no development experience. I chose web development because the result of your work is immediately visible. In general, programming helps to keep the brain in good shape.
